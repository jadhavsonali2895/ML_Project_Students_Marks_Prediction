**Students Marks Prediction**
This project aims to predict students' marks based on the number of study hours. It addresses several key business questions, including:

How many hours are needed to achieve a 99% mark?
How many hours are required to pass the exam?
If a student studies for a certain number of hours per day, what marks can they expect?

**Overview**
The project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to build a predictive model. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about students' study hours and corresponding marks.

**Features**
Data cleaning: Handling missing values by replacing them with the mean of the respective columns.
Model training: Using linear regression to establish the relationship between study hours and marks.
Model evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as coefficient of determination (RÂ²) and visualization techniques.
Model deployment: Saving the trained model for future use and deploying it locally for prediction.

**Usage**
_To use the project:_

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies (Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
Run the Jupyter Notebook (Students_Marks_Prediction.ipynb) to explore the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Save the trained model (Student_Marks_Prediction_Model.pkl) for future use.
Predict students' marks by providing the desired study hours using the deployed model.
Future Enhancements
Integration with a web application for easy prediction access.
Incorporation of additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
Deployment on cloud platforms for wider accessibility.
